# code-refactor

## Description

I completed this refactor to upgrade the accessibility across this site, which will ensure better access for people with disabilities. These improvements will also contribute to better search engine optimization.

The upgrades to this site include:

- Adding alt attributes to all elements accros the site
- Converting DIV tags to better Semantic alternatives
- Fixed and ensured that all nav links are working properly
- Consolidated repetitive CSS selectors
